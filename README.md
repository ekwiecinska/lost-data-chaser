# lost-data-chaser
For the '[Chasers of the Lost Data](https://2019.spaceappschallenge.org/challenges/planets-near-and-far/raiders-lost-data/details)' 
challenge for the [SpaceApps 2019 Hackathon](https://www.spaceappschallenge.org/).

**The Challenge**
> Help find ways to improve the performance of machine learning and predictive models by filling in gaps in the 
> datasets prior to model training. This entails finding methods to computationally recover or approximate data that 
> is missing due to sensor issues or signal noise that compromises experimental data collection. This work is 
> inspired by data collection during additive manufacturing (AM) processes where sensors capture build characteristics in-situ, but it has applications across many NASA domains.
